# Hacker Test History

The [Hacker Test](http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/Purity/hackpure.html) was an old test of how much of a 'hacker' (as in 'nerd', not 'cracker') you are. Since it came out in 1990, almost all of the questions are obsolete. That makes it a really neat historical document of what people considered cool at the time. Let's explain all the references!

If there's something you recognize, just make a pull request with the explanation. If there's an explanation you want to improve, just make a pull request with some history and links. We're not picky.

####  0005 Have you ever patched paper tape?

Paper type, also called [punched tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape) or perforated tape, was an early, inexpensive storage media, consisting of a long, thin strip of paper, divided into a fine grid (typically 5 or 8 columns). Each cell of this grid corresponded to one bit of information. If the grid was punched, the corresponding bit would be 1, otherwise it would be zero (or vice-versa).

Since paper is inexpensive and malleable, and the reading mechanism was usually optic, it would be very easy to "patch" paper tape: one could either punch holes, or cover erroneously punched holes by gluing electric tape or pieces of paper on top of them. However, doing so was fairly tedious and error prone, and you had to find it easy to "read" and "write" binary. Furthermore, finding out exactly *which* bits to toggle in this manner usually meant being able to read machine code dumps of the code -- not an easy feat!

####  0014 Do you eat slime-molds?

A reference to [NetHack](https://www.nethack.org/), one of the most popular roguelikes of all time. One item is the [fruit](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Slime_mold), which you could configure to be whatever food you like. If you do not configure it, the default is "slime mold"

####  0019 Can you recite Jabberwocky?

The [Jabberwocky](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html) is a famous nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll. Most of the words are made up.

####  003F Can you build a puffer train? (0040: ...Do you know what it is?)

A [puffer train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_train) is a particular type pattern in a finite automaton (like ]Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)) which spontaneously moves across the cell space, leaving smaller structures (akin to debris) behind.

Cellular automata are still a very popular pastime among hackers. Puffer trains, though, have particular cultural significance: the first known puffer train in Conway's Game of Life was discovered by [Bill Gosper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper).

#### 00B0 Do you have a copy of Dec Wars??

[DEC Wars](https://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/87/14917.9.html) was a [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation)-themed parody of Star Wars. It was posted on USENET, in various groups, in 1983, and was written by Alan Hastings, Steve Tarr, Dave Borman and Barak Pearlmutter.

#### 00B6 Do you have your own fortune-cookie file?

[fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) is a famous Unix passtime. When invoked, it would display various funny quotes from one of several files that shipped with it or were circulated in the hacker community. Particularly dedicated hackers would, of course, have such a file of their own.

#### 00C5 Do you have a programmable calculator?

Programmable calculators like the [TI-59](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-59_/_TI-58) were some of the earliest personal programmable devices. For many hackers, this would have been the first exposure to programming, and an occasional fun pastime.

Some of them, like the [HP-16C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-16C) were primarily aimed at programmers, but many hackers came from other fields, such as Physics or various other branches of engineering, where handheld scientific calculators are nearly impossible to live without.

#### 00C6 ... Is it RPN?

Notably, many of these scientific calculators used [RPN notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation); in particular, HP's line of scientific calculators, which were held in highest regard, used RPN from the very beginning, starting with the [HP-35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-35), the first scientific handheld calculator.

RPN did not become a tradition by accident or taste alone; the RPN model had a number of advantages relevant to early hardware, and implementing such a scheme in software was at the very least cleaner, if not easier. Programming languages like Lisp, Forth and PostScript used it extensively, too.
