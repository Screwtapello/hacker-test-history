# Hacker Test History

The [Hacker Test](http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/Purity/hackpure.html) was an old test of how much of a 'hacker' (as in 'nerd', not 'cracker') you are. Since it came out in 1990, almost all of the questions are obsolete. That makes it a really neat historical document of what people considered cool at the time. Let's explain all the references!

If there's something you recognize, just make a pull request with the explanation. If there's an explanation you want to improve, just make a pull request with some history and links. We're not picky.

####  0014 Do you eat slime-molds?

A reference to [NetHack](https://www.nethack.org/), one of the most popular roguelikes of all time. One item is the [fruit](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Slime_mold), which you could configure to be whatever food you like. If you do not configure it, the default is "slime mold"


####  0019 Can you recite Jabberwocky?

The [Jabberwocky](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html) is a famous nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll. Most of the words are made up.

#### 00B0 Do you have a copy of Dec Wars??

[DEC Wars](https://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/87/14917.9.html) was a [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation)-themed parody of Star Wars. It was posted on USENET, in various groups, in 1983, and was written by Alan Hastings, Steve Tarr, Dave Borman and Barak Pearlmutter.

#### 00B6 Do you have your own fortune-cookie file?

[fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) is a famous Unix passtime. When invoked, it would display various funny quotes from one of several files that shipped with it or were circulated in the hacker community. Particularly dedicated hackers would, of course, have such a file of their own.

#### 00C5 Do you have a programmable calculator?

Programmable calculators like the [TI-59](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-59_/_TI-58) were some of the earliest personal programmable devices. For many hackers, this would have been the first exposure to programming, and an occasional fun pastime.

Some of them, like the [HP-16C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-16C) were primarily aimed at programmers, but many hackers came from other fields, such as Physics or various other branches of engineering, where handheld scientific calculators are nearly impossible to live without.
