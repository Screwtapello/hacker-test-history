# Hacker Test History

The [Hacker Test](http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/Purity/hackpure.html) was an old test of how much of a 'hacker' (as in 'nerd', not 'cracker') you are. Since it came out in 1990, almost all of the questions are obsolete. That makes it a really neat historical document of what people considered cool at the time. Let's explain all the references!

If there's something you recognize, just make a pull request with the explanation. If there's an explanation you want to improve, just make a pull request with some history and links. We're not picky.

####  0014 Do you eat slime-molds?

A reference to [NetHack](https://www.nethack.org/), one of the most popular roguelikes of all time. One item is the [fruit](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Slime_mold), which you could configure to be whatever food you like. If you do not configure it, the default is "slime mold"


####  0019 Can you recite Jabberwocky?

The [Jabberwocky](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html) is a famous nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll. Most of the words are made up.
